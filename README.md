# Benford-s-law
This code reads in a grayscale image file, 
counts the number of pixels that have a given first digit, 
then calculates the proportion of the pixels having a given first digit 
and compares it with the expected proportion according to Benford's law.
It also shows a bar chart with the results.

results are not as expected
maybe image i'm uploading are not as random it seems
there are a lot types of image extensions maybe
that conversations are also disrupting randomness
MIGHT BE ACCURATE FOR STATISTICAL DATA
BUT NOT FILES LIKE IMAGES OR VIDEOS
